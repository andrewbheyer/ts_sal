<H2>1. SCOPE</H2>
This Interface Control Document (ICD) specifies the interface(s) between power and other subsystems. Upon formal approval by the line Manager responsible for each participating system, this ICD shall be incorporated into the requirements baseline for each system.
All the interfaces detailed herein are mediated by the OCS Middleware Software-Abstraction-Layer protocols, as detailed in ICD-SW-4.5.7.xx.

<H2>            1.2       Document Overview</H2>
The purpose of the ICD is to specify interface requirements to be met by the participating systems. It describes the concept of operations for the interface, defines the message structure and protocols which govern the interchange of data, and identifies the communication paths along which the data is expected to flow.

<BR>
<H3>Subsystem  description : ocs</H3>
 The Observatory Control System (OCS) is the master control system that schedules, coordinates, commands and monitors the observatory. 
Through the OCS the system can be started, adjusted during operations, monitored and stopped, both locally and remotely. 
The OCS provides the means to support safe observatory operations day and night.

<H2>3.       DETAILED INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS</H2>
<H2>            3.1       Commanding Requirements</H2>
There are two basic classes of commands used :
Lifecycle commands : commands used by OCS to control the lifecycle
characteristics of applications. Users generally do not need to be concerned with the lifecycle commands
because they are implemented by the underlying infrastructure.
<P>
Functional commands : commands that implement the specific functional characteristics of a
subsystem components.
<P>
Functional operation is based on the Command/Action/Response model that isolates the transmission of the
command from the resulting action that is performed. When an application receives a command, it validates any
Configuration associated with that command and immediately accepts or rejects the command. If the command is
accepted, the application then initiates an independent internal action to meet the conditions imposed by the
command. Once those conditions have been met, an event is posted signifying the successful completion of the
action (or the unsuccessful completion if the conditions can not be met).
<P>
Commands return immediately but the actions that are initiated as a result of a command may take some time to
complete. When the action completes, an action status event is posted that includes the completion status of that
action. The subsystem generating the command monitors this status event prior to issuing the command on the
remote system. While the monitoring is performed automatically by the command system, Subsystem developers
may need to attach a callback to perform processing on action completion. This callback may be null if no
processing is needed.
<P>
If a command is accepted by the subsystem it causes an independent action to begin. A response to the
command is returned immediately. The action begins matching the current configuration to the new demand
configuration. When the configurations match (i.e., the subsystem has performed the input operations) the action
signals the successful end of the action. If the configurations cannot be matched (whether by hardware failure,
external stop command, timeout, or some other fault) the action signals the unsuccessful end of the action.
<P>
The important features of the command/action/response model are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Commands are never blocked. As soon as one command is started, another one can be issued. The
behavior of the controller when two or more configurations are started can be configured on a
per subsystem basis.
<LI>The actions are performed using one or more separate threads. They can be tuned for priority, number of
simultaneous actions, critical resources, or any other parameters.
<LI>Action completions produce events that tell the state of the current configuration. Actions push the
lifecycle of the configuration through to completion.
<LI>Responses may be monitored by any other subsystems.<P>

<H3>                        3.2       Interface Processing Time Requirements</H3>
Command messages issued by ocs must be received by the computer system(s)
of the commanded subsystem within TDB ms. A preliminary response (ACK) must be issued within
TBD ms and received by ocs within TDB ms of the command origination time.
