set DATASTREAM_DESC(camera_TC_zone1) "
This subsystem comprises the devices and controllers necessary for monitoring and control of
the temperature of the focal plane sensors and front end electronics. This zone must be
maintained at approximately -100C to high accuracy (to be specified). Its function is to remove heat from the focal plane due to radiation through L1 as well as heat dissipated in the CCDs and Front End Cards"
