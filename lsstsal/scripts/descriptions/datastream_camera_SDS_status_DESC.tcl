set DATASTREAM_DESC(camera_SDS_status) "This subsystem comprises the science image sensors (201 CCDs), the front end electronics, the back end electronics, and a collection of electronics boards on a common bus along with the power supplies, cabling, fiber outputs, etc. needed to operate the CCDs in the science array. The 201 CCDs fully populate 21 focal plane rafts with 9 CCDs each and partially populate 4 rafts with 3 CCDs each. A dedicated state machine based controller issues timing and control signals to Camera Electronics. Specifically, it controls all signals required by both Front End Cards and Back End Cards. These include all CCD clocks, Signal Processing ASIC timing/control signals, A to D conversion control signals on the Back End, and so forth. Note that sensor data is normally not returned to the SAC, but is routed out of the camera on multiple Data Fibers. The control module for this subsystem would run on an embedded processor providing an interface between the CCM and the dedicated state machine based controller."
