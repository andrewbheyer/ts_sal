set SUBSYSTEM_DESC(m1m3) "Primary mirror system<P>
The primary is made from spun cast borosilicate blanks cast at the University
of Arizonaâ€™s Mirror Laboratory. These mirrors will use the standard hex cell pattern so the existing load spreader
designs can be used without modification. The arrangement of actuators and load spreaders has been adjusted near the
ID of the primary to adapt to the large center hole and the arrangement on the tertiary is adjusted as required at the OD.
Since we assume the use of the same support actuators as are in service on the LBT 8.4 m primary, the test data from
this set of actuators is relevant to the evaluation of support force errors.
<P>
Weight of the primary is 12,526 kg.
This includes the weight of the bonded on
load spreaders. Primary results are based on frequent
system corrections for focus, coma and astigmatism. The
primary benefits from this due to a relatively soft
astigmatic bending mode attributable to the large center
hole. This correction, while desirable, is not necessary."
