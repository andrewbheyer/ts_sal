set SUBSYSTEM_DESC(lasercal) "LSST Focal plane Laser Spot Alignment Pattern Projection System<BR>
 An array of laser spots generated by shining a laser 
  through a diffraction grating is projected onto the focal 
  plane imaging sensors as a fixed reference pattern
<P>
 The CCDs are read out and the locations of these laser 
  spots are stored
<P>
 Displacements of the apparent spot locations on 
  subsequent read outs can be used to infer shifts in the 
  positions of the CCD sensors
<P>
Spot generation using an optimized micromachined 2D array of apertures
A diffraction grating where the dimensions of the open apertures are on the order of the wavelength of the laser will generate a projected array of spots with relatively uniform amplitudes"
