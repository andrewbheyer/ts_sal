<H2>1. SCOPE</H2>
This Interface Control Document (ICD) specifies the interface(s) between seeing_dimm and other subsystems. Upon formal approval by the line Manager responsible for each participating system, this ICD shall be incorporated into the requirements baseline for each system.
All the interfaces detailed herein are mediated by the OCS Middleware Software-Abstraction-Layer protocols, as detailed in ICD-SW-4.5.7.xx.

<H2>            1.2       Document Overview</H2>
The purpose of the ICD is to specify interface requirements to be met by the participating systems. It describes the concept of operations for the interface, defines the message structure and protocols which govern the interchange of data, and identifies the communication paths along which the data is expected to flow.

<H2>2.       CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS</H2>
<H2>            2.1       System Overviews</H2>
<BR>
<H3>Subsystem  description : ocs</H3>
 The Observatory Control System (OCS) is the master control system that schedules, coordinates, commands and monitors the observatory. 
Through the OCS the system can be started, adjusted during operations, monitored and stopped, both locally and remotely. 
The OCS provides the means to support safe observatory operations day and night.

<P>
<H3>Subsystem  description : seeing_dimm</H3>
Seeing canmera, differential image motion monitor<P>
The first DIMM was developed by M. Sarazin and F. Roddier (Sarazin, M., Roddier, F., The ESO differential image motion monitor, 1990, Astron. Astrophy. 227, 294). Refer to this paper for more complete information, especially on the theory.
<P>
Image quality through a telescope is directly related to the statistics of the perturbations of the incoming wavefront. The DIMM method consists of measuring wavefront slope differences over 2 small pupils some distance apart. Because it is a differential method, the technique is inherently insensitive to tracking errors and wind shake. In practice, starlight goes through 2 small circular subapertures, cut in a mask placed at the entrance of a small telescope. One of the subapertures contains a prism in order to create a second image of the star on the detector. The dual star images obtained exhibit a relative motion in the image plane that represents the local wavefront tilts, which can be expressed in terms of an absolute seeing scale 
<P>Sources of error:<BR>
Pixel scale: the FWHM varies as the 6/5 power of the standard deviation of the motion, which is measured in fractions of pixels. The pixel angular scale is determined typically with a 1% accuracy, leading to a 1.2% error in the FWHM.
<P>
Instrumental noise: the accuracy of the centroid algorithm, measured in laboratory on 2 fixed spots, corresponds to an equivalent random error of about 0.03 arcsec rms.
<P>
Statistical errors: it decreases with the square root of the sampling (number of images used). In our case, the variance of image motion is obtained from typically 250 short exposures per minute in each direction (i.e.. 500 in total), which leads to an accuracy of 3.8% in the image size.
<P>
Exposure time: the error caused by the finite exposure time is minimized by using very short exposures that can freeze the motion of the atmosphere in most conditions. We implemented the 5ms to 10ms (the minimum CCD frame transfer time is 1ms) interleaving technique and calculate (and log) the extrapolated seeing for a virtual integration time of 0ms (we know from ESO that 5ms is freezing the image motion 99% of the time in Chilean sites).
<P>

<H2>3.       DETAILED INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS</H2>
<H2>            3.1       Commanding Requirements</H2>
There are two basic classes of commands used :
Lifecycle commands : commands used by OCS to control the lifecycle
characteristics of applications. Users generally do not need to be concerned with the lifecycle commands
because they are implemented by the underlying infrastructure.
<P>
Functional commands : commands that implement the specific functional characteristics of a
subsystem components.
<P>
Functional operation is based on the Command/Action/Response model that isolates the transmission of the
command from the resulting action that is performed. When an application receives a command, it validates any
Configuration associated with that command and immediately accepts or rejects the command. If the command is
accepted, the application then initiates an independent internal action to meet the conditions imposed by the
command. Once those conditions have been met, an event is posted signifying the successful completion of the
action (or the unsuccessful completion if the conditions can not be met).
<P>
Commands return immediately but the actions that are initiated as a result of a command may take some time to
complete. When the action completes, an action status event is posted that includes the completion status of that
action. The subsystem generating the command monitors this status event prior to issuing the command on the
remote system. While the monitoring is performed automatically by the command system, Subsystem developers
may need to attach a callback to perform processing on action completion. This callback may be null if no
processing is needed.
<P>
If a command is accepted by the subsystem it causes an independent action to begin. A response to the
command is returned immediately. The action begins matching the current configuration to the new demand
configuration. When the configurations match (i.e., the subsystem has performed the input operations) the action
signals the successful end of the action. If the configurations cannot be matched (whether by hardware failure,
external stop command, timeout, or some other fault) the action signals the unsuccessful end of the action.
<P>
The important features of the command/action/response model are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Commands are never blocked. As soon as one command is started, another one can be issued. The
behavior of the controller when two or more configurations are started can be configured on a
per subsystem basis.
<LI>The actions are performed using one or more separate threads. They can be tuned for priority, number of
simultaneous actions, critical resources, or any other parameters.
<LI>Action completions produce events that tell the state of the current configuration. Actions push the
lifecycle of the configuration through to completion.
<LI>Responses may be monitored by any other subsystems.<P>

<H3>                        3.2       Interface Processing Time Requirements</H3>
Command messages issued by ocs must be received by the computer system(s)
of the commanded subsystem within TDB ms. A preliminary response (ACK) must be issued within
TBD ms and received by ocs within TDB ms of the command origination time.
