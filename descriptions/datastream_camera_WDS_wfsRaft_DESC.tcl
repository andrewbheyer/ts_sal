<P>This subsystem maintains metadata concerning the state of the<BR>wavefront
sensors, and the results of the processing of<BR>images. Items such
as chip voltages, health, per chip temps<BR>bad pixel/line/column
counts, image pair counts, zernike results<BR>and so on. 
The wavefront sensing system will consist of wavefront curvature monitors and/or Shack Hartmann sensors in or around
the science array. Data from these sensors will be used to monitor and improve the quality of the science data by using WF
measurements for feedback compensation. The feedback control of telescope alignment will be handled by the
Telescope Control System.
<P>
Four special purpose rafts, mounted at the corners of the science array, will contain wavefront sensors and guide sensors.
Wavefront measurements are accomplished using curvature sensing, where the spatial intensity distribution of stars is
measured at equal distances on either side of focus. Each curvature sensor will be composed of two CCD detectors, with
one positioned slightly above the focal plane, and the other positioned slightly below the focal plane. The CCD technology
for the curvature sensors will be identical to that used for the science detectors in the focal plane except that the curvature
sensor detectors will be half size so they can be mounted as an in/out defocus pair. Detailed analyses have verified that this
configuration can recover the wavefront to the required accuracy.
