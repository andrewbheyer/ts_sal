set SUBSYSTEM_DESC(camera) "The camera is one of the three primary LSST technical subsystems (along with the Telescope/Site Subsystem and the
Data Management Subsystem). It contains a 3.2 Gigapixel focal plane array, comprised of roughly 200 4K x 4K CCD
sensors, with 10 micron pixels. 
<P>The sensors are deep depleted, back illuminated devices with a highly segmented
architecture that enables the entire array to be read out in 2 s or less. These detectors are grouped into 3 x 3 arrays called
rafts. Each raft contains its own dedicated front end and back end electronics boards, which fit within the footprint of its
sensors, thus serving as a 144 Megapixel camera on its own. 
<P>All of the rafts, with their associated electronics, are mounted
on a silicon carbide grid inside a vacuum cryostat, with an intricate thermal control system that maintains the CCDs at an
operating temperature of roughly minus 90 degrees centigrade.
<P>The grid also contains sets of guide sensors and wavefront
sensors at the edge of the field. The entire grid, with the sensors, is actuated at a rate ~ 30 Hz in a fast guiding mode to
maintain a very narrow psf (0.7 arcseconds median), which is limited mainly by seeing fluctuations in the overlying
atmosphere.
<P>The entrance window to the cryostat is the third of the three refractive lenses. The other two lenses are mounted in an optics
structure at the front of the camera body. The camera body also contains a mechanical shutter, and a carrousel assembly
that holds five large optical filters, any of which can be inserted into the camera field of view for a given exposure. A sixth
optical filter will also be fabricated which can replace any of the five via an automated procedure accomplished during
daylight hours.
<P>
The camera system consists of multiple subsystems that include utilities, the camera body vessel and mechanisms for
shuttering and optical filtering, the imaging sensors, optical lenses and filters, a computerized data acquisition and control
system, the cryostat holding the detector array, readout and control electronics, wavefront sensors, and guide sensors."
