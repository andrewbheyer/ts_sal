set SUBSYSTEM_DESC(enclosure) "Dome and enclosure<BR>
1.1.Basic Functions: The purpose of the dome is to protect the telescope and camera from adverse environmental conditions both during observing and when not in operation.  The clear optical path provided by the dome, the contribution of dome seeing to the overall error budget, and the operational parameters of the dome will be consistent with the Telescope Requirements Document (Doc # 2389)
<P>Thermally Benign: A fundamental objective in the dome design will be maintaining a beneficial thermal environment for the seeing performance of the telescope.  Preconditioning of the telescope environment, passive ventilation, the use of materials with low thermal inertia, and other strategies will be employed for that purpose.
<P>Special LSST Survey Requirements: As a telescope dedicated to a demanding survey program, LSST has some special characteristics that are reflected in the dome requirements:
A critical need to shield the telescope from stray light due to the wide 3.5º telescope observing angle
A higher than normal requirement for dome reliability imposed by the continuous nature of the survey observing regime. 
A faster than normal dome tracking speed required by the rapid paced, robotic observing cadence.
<P>
Maintenance: In addition to its operational characteristics, the dome provides adequate enclosed space and appropriate facilities for engineering and maintenance work on the telescope, camera, and on the dome itself.
<P>
Coordination with Telescope, Optics and Instrument Design: Designs for the telescope mount, optics, and camera are ongoing.  The baseline dimensions and operational characteristics of these elements are, however, well enough understood to allow development of an appropriate dome to enclose and service these systems.  Further refinements in telescope and camera design will be incorporated into future versions of this document, and later reflected in the detailed design of the dome.
<P>
Coordination with the Lower Enclosure: The lower enclosure that supports the dome is a fixed building with requirements described in the Support Facility Design Requirements Document (Doc # 342). The dimensional and structural criteria for the lower enclosure are dictated by the dome.
<P>
Code Compliance and Structural Loads:  All aspects of the LSST dome will comply with current editions of the International Building Code, OSHA regulations, and other applicable design and construction standards as specified by LSST.  Wind and seismic loads for dome design will be developed based on the latest available historical and regional data.
<P>
Site: The LSST observatory will be located at the El Peñón peak on Cerro Pachón in Chile.  This is a mountaintop location at an elevation of approximately 2650m (8692 ft.) above sea level, and is subject to severe weather conditions.  This site is also subject to relatively high earthquake risk, with correspondingly high design factors for seismic acceleration.   The dome will be designed to withstand these and other specific environmental conditions of the site."
