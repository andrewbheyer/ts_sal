set DATASTREAM_DESC(camera_VCS) "The Vacuum Control Subsystem (VCS) manager software controls and synchronizes operation of the vacuum and purge subsystem in the camera cryostat and utility trunk (either on the mountain or in the lab).  Feedback control is based on vacuum pumps and pressure gauges.
<P>This subsystem maintains application level data for the dewar<BR>vacuum
systems. Target and actual statuses<BR>health , limits, etc.
<P>
The inner cryostat housing contains the focal plane array with its frontend and backend electronics, elements of the thermal management system, and all lectrical, optical, fluid and mechanical feedthroughs. The lens, L3, forms the window on the ront end of the cryostat housing. A rear flange to the inner housing provides primary access to components inside.
<P>
<LI>On Camera vacuum manifolds, valves, pump ports, transfer lines, and plena. Getter and ion holding pumps on
Cryostat, including regeneration heaters and valving. RGA, ion gauge, TQCM, and controllers.
<LI>On Camera purge manifolds, valves, pump ports, and pressure vessel. Metering, temp sensors, reheaters, power
supplies and controllers. Insulated purge flex lines to camera.
<LI>On the ground: Purge reheat controller, chiller, meters, filters, sensors, flow control valves, racks and consoles.
<P>The focal plane array is contained in vacuum to minimize its environmental heat load. While vacuum eliminates natural convection, other modes of heat transfer are still present. Multi layer insulation applied to the cryostat housing all but eliminates radiation heat transfer except where it cannot be such as the vacuum window (L3). Supporting the focal plane array on flexures naturally minimizes conduction through structures."
