set SUBSYSTEM_DESC(m2) "Secondary mirror system
<P>This mirror is
designed to be made from an existing 350 mm thick Zerodur blank. It is a bit thinner than would be needed to provide a
completely passive support (one that would never need to have the surface figure measured and corrected by adjusting
the actuator forces). The secondary has a back sheet thickness of 3.81 cm (1.5 inches), and a face sheet of similar
thickness except near the OD where the fabrication process requires that the internal surface of the face sheet be
parallel to the back surface resulting in an increase in the average face sheet thickness toward the OD. . It is approximately 63% lightweighted.
The LSST secondary is axially supported through load spreaders and pucks bonded to the back of the mirror . Fourteen three puck load spreaders are used along with 62 single puck actuator interfaces. A single axial
actuator loads the six inner three puck load spreaders. Two axial actuators load four of the three puck load spreaders
and three axial actuators load the remaining four. The three puck loadspreaders loaded by multiple actuators are
provided where static supports are used since these require the three puck frame to carry lateral loads. All load
spreaders are similar to the loadspreaders already in use on 6.5 and 8.4 m primary mirrors and consist of an Invar 36
frame bolted to puck assemblies that are bonded to the mirror with a 4 mm layer of silicone adhesive (GE RTV630).
The silicone adhesive layer is perforated with 2 mm diameter holes spaced 20 mm apart to reduce the axial stiffness of
the bond to approximately 120 kN/mm. Lateral support is provided at twenty of the pockets at two different depths.
The six innermost laterals support 46% of the weight 60.2 mm (2.37”) in front of the CG (center of gravity) plane. The
remaining 14 lateral supports carry 54% of the weight 82.6 mm (2.03”) behind the CG plane.
<P>
The axial support force actuators are counterweight mechanisms. 
They are equipped with load cells and an active
force capability for the compensation of thermal distortion due to
thermal expansion inhomogeneity and to provide axial correction
forces proportional to the lateral gravity component. Additionally,
forces will be adjusted to obtain the desired reactions at the position
constraints (hardpoints). Tapered roller bearings are used at all
rotating joints including the two universal joints in the connecting
rods."
