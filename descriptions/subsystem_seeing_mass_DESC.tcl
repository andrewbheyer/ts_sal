Multi Aperture Scintillation Sensing (MASS). By correlating scintillation patterns in different annular pupils in a telescope the altitude and strength of turbulent motions in the atmosphere, where the scintillation originates, can be deduced. 
<P>
When stellar light passes through a turbulent layer and propagates down, its intensity fluctuates. Spatial scale of these variations depends on the distance to the layer. This dependence is used to separate the contributions from different layers by means of four concentric ring apertures that work as a matched spatial filter. Turbulence profile is derived from the statistical processing of the series of photon counts with 1 ms sampling.
<P>
Intensity of light falling into each of the ring apertures A, B, C, and D (see below) is measured by photon counters.  Scintillation index  in each aperture is computed as the variance (dispersion) of intensity normalized by the average intensity squared (or, equivalently, variance of the natural logarithm). In this way the scintillation index does not depend on the brightness of the star and reflects only the strength of atmospheric scintillation. Contribution of photon noise is carefully subtracted in the calculation.
<P>
Similarly, differential scintillation index for a pair of apertures (e.g. A and B) is defined as the variance of the ratio of intensities in A and B normalized by the square of the average intensity ratio A/B (or, equivalently, the variance of the natural logarithm of the intensity ratio).
<P>
Both normal and differential scintillation indices produced by a given turbulent layer are computed as product of the turbulence intensity in this layer (integral of Cn2 measured in m^1/3) by some weighting function which depends on the distance to the layer as well as on the shape and size of the apertures."
