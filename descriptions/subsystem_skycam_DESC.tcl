The primary goal is to provide qualitative assessment of cloud patterns (detection, layout and motion).  Thick clouds on large spatial scales can be detected by almost any camera, but as they can also be readily seen by eye, this is not a very interesting case  ...except for remote users.  The primary goal of this project is to detect diffuse Cirrus which is more common and very difficult or impossible to see by eye in the moonless sky.    Side benefits (which I will discuss later) are aircraft detection (for laser safety), sky brightness monitoring (light pollution versus cloud cover and time of day), monitoring of OH emissions and auroras, and monitoring of clouds under moonlight or even daylight for remote observers.  Finally, the impact of high quality images of the skies over Tololo on the public, particularly the astronomical community, should not be overlooked, particularly if they are superior in quality to those offered in the North (e.g.  Mauna Kea, and Kitt Peak)

Since the dark sky is almost invariant from night to night it is possible to subtract a reference frame formed from the median of previous (dark) nights so that a nominally flat image can be displayed at sufficient contrast to allow extinction and scattering to be perceived down to the limit imposed by the photon shot noise.   This has been demonstrated crudely by derotating clear frames taken on the same night.  Much better results will be obtained when the camera remains in a fixed position from night to night so that no derotation is needed.

Pixels can be binned together to improve the noise statistics, but only until the typical spatial scale of the clouds is reached.   Unfortunately a comparison of the angular scale of daytime Cirrus with that of the the moon or an outstretched thumb will quickly confirm that  the proposed resolution of 0.18 degrees (960 pixels across the sky) is not excessive, and that only slight binning can be used if at all.  This fine angular scale and the high winds found at altitude combine to require exposure times shorter than ~3 seconds to maintain acceptable contrast for Cirrus."
