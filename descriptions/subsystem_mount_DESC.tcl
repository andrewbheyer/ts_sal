set SUBSYSTEM_DESC(mount) "Telescope mount and axes<BR>
Optically the LSST telescope has a unique 3 mirror system. The primary mirror circumscribes
the tertiary mirror such that both surfaces can be made into a single monolithic substrate 
The camera assembly is also circumscribed within the secondary mirror
assembly, forming a convenient package at the telescope top end.
Although the LSST optical design is unique, it can be supported by a conventional telescope
structural arrangement. A stiff mirror cell is used to support the primary and tertiary mirrors, and the top end assembly supports both the secondary mirror assembly and the camera assembly. Both the elevation axis and the azimuth axis are expected to utilize hydrostatic bearings, which are common on large telescopes.
<P>The LSSTs structural arrangement facilitates maintainability. The primary/tertiary mirror cell is connected to the rest of the elevation assembly at four flange locations. This facilitates convenient removal and reinstallation of the mirror cell for recoating and any significant maintenance needs. The top end assembly is also only attached at four flange locations to facilitate removal. The hydrostatic bearing surfaces are enclosed to reduce contamination and susceptibility to damage.
<P>The mount design also incorporates many essential auxiliary components.
Among these are the baffle system, balancing system, damping system, mirror cover, cable wraps and motor drives. The mirror cell is a 2 m deep sandwich with access to the complex systems required for mounting and thermal control of the primary and tertiary mirrors.
<P>Preliminary analysis determined that the lowest natural frequencies of the telescope assembly should be 10 Hz or greater to meet the slew and settling requirements. The telescope mount assembly was designed and analyzed with FEA, with the goal of meeting this 10 Hz requirement. The top end assembly supports the mass of the secondary mirror assembly and camera assembly through the use of 16 hollow rectangular spiders. 
<P>
These hollow spiders are structurally efficient, and the interior provides a convenient location to route the many cables required by the camera and the secondary mirror. These spiders have exterior dimensions of 300 mm x 50 mm and interior dimensions of 210 mm x 36 mm.
<P>The spiders are arranged to minimize the image degradation. All the spiders are arranged in axially aligned pairs. Consequently, the focal plane only sees eight spiders. The eight spider pairs are in a parallel/perpendicular arrangement, which only produces 2 diffraction spikes.
<P>
The instrument assembly includes the camera, rotator, hexapod, cable wrap, integrating
structure and electronics assemblies. The rotator is located between the hexapod and the camera to provide rotation about the optical axis during tracking. The hexapod resides between the rotator and integrating structure, and is used to provide alignment and positioning. 
The electronics assemblies mount to the interior of the integrating structure. The cable wrap resides on the top of the integrating structure.
<P>
The entire instrument assembly can be installed and removed as a single unit. This allows the entire instrument assembly to be put together and tested before integration into the telescope. It also provides for the removal for service and repairs. This installation feature requires that all cabling for the camera be routed from the cameraâ€™s top surface, through the hexapod and the cable wrap and to the integrating structures top surface.
<P>
The secondary mirror assembly is a 100 mm thick glass meniscus supported by 120 axial actuators and 6 tangent actuators and a structural cell for
support. The entire secondary mirror assembly is attached to the top end spider spindle by 6
positioning actuators. The mounting system includes an interface plate to allow removal of the secondary mirror assembly without disconnecting the position actuators. 
The secondary mirror assembly also incorporates a large baffle."
