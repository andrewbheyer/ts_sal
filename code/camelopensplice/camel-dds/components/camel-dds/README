Camel DDS
==========

Welcome to the Camel DDS transport for communicating with Jabber servers.

For more details see

  http://activemq.apache.org/camel/dds.html

Using Spring based xml configuration in 'activemq.xml'
------------------------------------------------------

In this example an dds user called 'bot' will propagate any messages to the queue 'gimme_an_a' to a muc called 'monitor'. The conference subdomain is part of openfire muc jid implementation (i guess). Notice the quoted ampersands.

<camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring">
    <route>
        <from uri="activemq:gimme_an_a"/>
        <to uri="dds://bot@freetwix.hh/?port=5222&amp;password=meapassword&amp;room=monitor@conference.freetwix.hh"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>


Running the Integration Tests
-----------------------------

To run the intergration tests you need a Jabber server to communicate with such as Jive Software's WildFire

To enable the integration tests set the maven property

  dds.enable = true

You may also want to overload the default value of the server to connect with via

  dds.url = dds://camel@localhost/?login=false&room=
