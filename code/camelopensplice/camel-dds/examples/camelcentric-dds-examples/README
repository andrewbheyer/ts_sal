Examples
--------
The camelcentric examples demonstrate routing of camel messages with DDS as the underlying transport.

Building
--------
Open a command prompt and change directory to camelcentric-dds-examples.
Enter the following command: mvn install


Example 1. StringMessage: This example demonstrates routing of camel messages with string as the message body.

Open a command prompt and enter the following command to run the example:

mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=camelcentric.dds.examples.StringMessage

Type a string message and press <ENTER>.

The message will be routed back to the application and displayed.
If multiple instances of the application are executed, all the instances will receive the message.


Type quit and press <ENTER> to exit the application.


Example 2. POJOMessage: This example demonstrates routing of camel messages with a serializable Java Object as the message body.
The Java Object in this example is has two variables describing a location: "city" of type String and "zip" of type integer.

Open a command prompt and enter the following command to run the example:

mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=camelcentric.dds.examples.POJOMessage

Type city,zip and press <ENTER>. (Example: Boston,01803 )

The Java Object will be serialized and routed back to the application and displayed.
If multiple instances of the application are executed, all the instances will receive the message.


Type quit and press <ENTER> to exit the application.
