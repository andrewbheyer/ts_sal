To build this project, do the following, starting from the project root.
You will need the cmake build tool and the boost utility library.

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..          # Generated Makefiles
$ make              # Compiles code into object files
$ make install      # Copies object files into project local/ directory

If cmake cannot find your boost installation, pass its location like this:

$ cmake -DBOOST_ROOT=<directory> ..

If the version of g++ that cmake looks for is not available on your system,
you can override it by editing the file cmake/psm-macros.cmake.
