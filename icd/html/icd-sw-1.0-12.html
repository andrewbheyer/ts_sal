----------ADD NETWORK DIAGRAM HERE-----------------------


<P>
<BR>
<H4>Software</H4>
The publish-subscribe communications model provides a more efficient model for broad data distribution over a network than point-to-point, client-server, and distributed object models. Rather than each node directly addressing other nodes to exchange data, publish-subscribe provides a communications layer that delivers data transparently from the nodes publishing the data to the nodes subscribing to the data.
Publishers send events to the communications layer, which in turn, passes the events to subscribers. In this way, a single event published by a publisher can be sent to multiple subscribers. Events are categorized by topic, and subscribers specify the topics they are interested in. Only events that match a subscribers topic are sent to that subscriber. The service permits selection of a number of quality-of-service criteria to allow applications to choose the appropriate trade-off between reliability and performance.
<P>
The combination of Client-Server and Publish-Subscribe models leads to the concept of Command/Action/Response model, in that the transmission of commands is decoupled from the action that executes that command. A command will return immediately; the action begins in a separate thread. Figure 3 illustrate this model by means of a simplified sequence diagram. When an application receives a command, it validates the attributes associated with that command and immediately accepts or rejects the command. If the command is accepted, the application then initiates an independent internal action to meet the conditions imposed by the command. Once those conditions have been met, an event is posted signifying the successful completion of the action (or the unsuccessful completion if the condition not be met). In this figure, callbacks are implemented using the event features of the publish-subscribe model.
<P>
<IMG SRC="omg.jpg"><P>
Information flows with the aid of the following constructs : Publisher and DataWriter
on the sending side, Subscriber, and DataReader on the receiving side.
<P>
A Publisher is an object responsible for data distribution. It may publish data of
different data types. A DataWriter acts as a typed4 accessor to a publisher. The
DataWriter is the object the application must use to communicate to a publisher the
existence and value of data-objects of a given type. When data-object values have
been communicated to the publisher through the appropriate data-writer, it is the
publisher's responsibility to perform the distribution (the publisher will do this
according to its own QoS, or the QoS attached to the corresponding data-writer). A
publication is defined by the association of a data-writer to a publisher. This
association expresses the intent of the application to publish the data described by
the data-writer in the context provided by the publisher.
<P>
A Subscriber is an object responsible for receiving published data and making it
available (according to the Subscribers QoS) to the receiving application. It may
receive and dispatch data of different specified types. To access the received data,
the application must use a typed DataReader attached to the subscriber. Thus, a
subscription is defined by the association of a data-reader with a subscriber. This
association expresses the intent of the application to subscribe to the data described
by the data-reader in the context provided by the subscriber.
<P>
Topic objects conceptually fit between publications and subscriptions. Publications must
be known in such a way that subscriptions can refer to them unambiguously. A Topic is
meant to fulfill that purpose: it associates a name (unique in the domain), a data-type,
and QoS related to the data itself. In addition to the topic QoS, the QoS of the
DataWriter associated with that Topic and the QoS of the Publisher associated to the
DataWriter control the behavior on the publisher's side, while the corresponding Topic,
DataReader, and Subscriber QoS control the behavior on the subscribers side.
<P>
When an application wishes to publish data of a given type, it must create a Publisher
(or reuse an already created one) and a DataWriter with all the characteristics of the
desired publication. Similarly, when an application wishes to receive data, it must create
a Subscriber (or reuse an already created one) and a DataReader to define the
subscription.
<P>
QoS (Quality of Service) is a general concept that is used to specify the behavior of a
service. Programming service behavior by means of QoS settings offers the advantage
that the application developer only indicates what is wanted rather than how this QoS
should be achieved. Generally speaking, QoS is comprised of several QoS policies. Each
QoS policy is then an independent description that associates a name with a value.
Describing QoS by means of a list of independent QoS policies gives rise to more
flexibility.
<P>
This specification is designed to allow a clear separation between the publish and the
subscribe sides, so that an application process that only participates as a publisher can
embed just what strictly relates to publication. Similarly, an application process that
participates only as a subscriber can embed only what strictly relates to subscription.
<P>
Underlying any data-centric publish subscribe system is a data model. This model
defines the global data space and specifies how Publishers and Subscribers refer to
portions of this space. The data-model can be as simple as a set of unrelated datastructures,
each identified by a topic and a type. The topic provides an identifier that
uniquely identifies some data items within the global data space1. The type provides
structural information needed to tell the middleware how to manipulate the data and also
allows the middleware to provide a level of type safety. However, the target applications
often require a higher-level data model that allows expression of aggregation and
coherence relationships among data elements.
<P>
Another common need is a Data Local Reconstruction Layer (DLRL) that automatically
reconstructs the data locally from the updates and allows the application to access the
data as if it were local. In that case, the middleware not only propagates the
information to all interested subscribers but also updates a local copy of the information.
<P>
<H2>            2.2       Functional Allocation</H2>

----------ADD PER DEVICE COMMAND TYPES HERE-----------------------

<H2>            2.3       Data Transfer</H2>
<BR>
<H3>Hardware - Ethernet</H3>
<P>
Ethernet stations communicate by sending each other data packets, small blocks of data that are individually sent and delivered. As with other IEEE 802 LANs, each Ethernet station is given a single 48-bit MAC address, which is used both to specify the destination and the source of each data packet. Network interface cards (NICs) or chips normally do not accept packets addressed to other Ethernet stations. Adapters generally come programmed with a globally unique address, but this can be overridden, either to avoid an address change when an adapter is replaced, or to use locally administered addresses.
<P>
Main procedure
<P><UL>
<LI>   1. Frame ready for transmission
<LI>   2. Is medium idle? If not, wait until it becomes ready and wait the interframe gap period (9.6 µs in 10 Mbit/s Ethernet).
<LI>   3. Start transmitting
<LI>   4. Does a collision occur? If so, go to collision detected procedure.
<LI>   5. Reset retransmission counters and end frame transmission
<LI>   6. Collision detected procedure , Continue transmission until minimum packet time is reached (jam signal) to ensure that all receivers detect the collision
<LI>   7. Increment retransmission counter
<LI>   8. Is maximum number of transmission attempts reached? If so, abort transmission.
<LI>   9. Calculate and wait random backoff period based on number of collisions
<LI>  10. Re-enter main procedure at stage 1
</UL><P>

Frames are the format of data packets on the wire. Note that a frame viewed on the actual physical hardware would show start bits, sometimes called the preamble, and the trailing Frame Check Sequence. These are required by all physical hardware and is seen in all four following frame types. They are not displayed by packet sniffing software because these bits are removed by the Ethernet adapter before being passed on to the network protocol stack software.

<H3>Software - OMG DDS </H3>
The OMG Data-Distribution Service (DDS) is a new specification for publish-subscribe data-distribution systems. The purpose of the specification is to provide a common application-level interface that clearly defines the data-distribution service. The specification describes the service using UML, providing a platform-independent model that can then be mapped into a variety of concrete platforms and programming languages.
<P>
The goal of the DDS specification is to facilitate the efficient distribution of data in a distributed system. Participants using DDS can read and write data efficiently and naturally with a typed interface. Underneath, the DDS middleware will distribute the data so that each reading participant can access the most-current values. In effect, the service creates a global data space that any participant can read and write. It also creates a name space to allow participants to find and share objects.
<P>
DDS targets real-time systems; the API and QoS are chosen to balance predictable behavior and implementation efficiency/performance.

<H3>Notification/Alert</H3>

Logging service for collecting, recording, and analyzing system messages. The logging service supports multiple messages categories (e.g. Error, debug, informative) and message levels (e.g. Different levels of debug messages).

<H2>            2.5       Security and Integrity</H2>
<BR>
<H3>Hardware</H3>
<P><H4>Firewall</H4>
A firewall's basic task is to regulate the flow of traffic between computer networks of different trust levels. Typical examples are the Internet which is a zone with no trust and an internal network which is a zone of higher trust. A zone with an intermediate trust level, situated between the Internet and a trusted internal network, is often referred to as a perimeter network or Demilitarized zone (DMZ).

<H4>Packet filtering</H4>
Packet filters act by inspecting the packets which represent the basic unit of data transfer between computers on the Internet. If a packet matches the packet filter's set of rules, the packet filter will drop (silently discard) the packet, or reject it (discard it, and send error responses to the source).
<P>
This type of packet filtering pays no attention to whether a packet is part of an existing stream of traffic (it stores no information on connection state). Instead, it filters each packet based only on information contained in the packet itself (most commonly using a combination of the packet's source and destination address, its protocol, and, for TCP and UDP traffic, which comprises most internet communication, the port number).
<P>
Because TCP and UDP traffic by convention uses well known ports for particular types of traffic, a stateless packet filter can distinguish between, and thus control, those types of traffic (such as web browsing, remote printing, email transmission, file transfer), unless the machines on each side of the packet filter are both using the same non-standard ports.
Second Generation firewalls do not simply examine the contents of each packet on an individual basis without regard to their placement within the packet series as their predecessors had done, rather they compare some key parts of the trusted database packets. This technology is generally referred to as a 'stateful firewall' as it maintains records of all connections passing through the firewall, and is able to determine whether a packet is the start of a new connection, or part of an existing connection. Though there is still a set of static rules in such a firewall, the state of a connection can in itself be one of the criteria which trigger specific rules.
<P>
This type of firewall can help prevent attacks which exploit existing connections, or certain Denial-of-service attacks, including the SYN flood which sends improper sequences of packets to consume resources on systems behind a firewall.
<P>
<H4>Private subnet</H4>
Firewalls often have network address translation (NAT) functionality, and the hosts protected behind a firewall commonly have addresses in the private address range, as defined in RFC 1918. Firewalls often have such functionality to hide the true address of protected hosts. Originally, the NAT function was developed to address the limited amount of IPv4 routable addresses that could be used or assigned to companies or individuals as well as reduce both the amount and therefore cost of obtaining enough public addresses for every computer in an organization. Hiding the addresses of protected devices has become an increasingly important defense against network reconnaissance.

<BR>
<H3>Software</H3>

<H4>NDDS domains</H4>
The domain is the basic construct used to bind
individual applications together for
communication. A distributed application can
elect to use a single domain for all its data-centric
communications. 
<P>
All Data Writers and Data Readers with like data
types will communicate within this domain.
DDS also has the capability to support multiple
domains, thus providing developers a system that
can scale with system needs or segregate based
on different data types. When a specific data
instance is published on one domain, it will not
be received by subscribers residing on any other
domains.
<P>
Multiple domains provide effective data
isolation. One use case would be for a system to
be designed whereby all Command/Control
related data is exchanged via one domain while
Status information is exchanged within another. 
Multiple domains are also a good way to control
the introduction of new functionality into an
existing system.
<P>



<H2>3.0       DETAILED INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS</H2>
<H2>            3.1       Commanding Requirements</H2>
There are two basic classes of commands used :
Lifecycle commands : commands used by OCS to control the lifecycle
characteristics of applications. Users generally do not need to be concerned with the lifecycle commands
because they are implemented by the underlying infrastructure.
<P>
Functional commands : commands that implement the specific functional characteristics of a
subsystem components.
<P>
Functional operation is based on the Command/Action/Response model that isolates the transmission of the
command from the resulting action that is performed. When an application receives a command, it validates any
Configuration associated with that command and immediately accepts or rejects the command. If the command is
accepted, the application then initiates an independent internal action to meet the conditions imposed by the
command. Once those conditions have been met, an event is posted signifying the successful completion of the
action (or the unsuccessful completion if the conditions can not be met).
<P>
Commands return immediately but the actions that are initiated as a result of a command may take some time to
complete. When the action completes, an action status event is posted that includes the completion status of that
action. The subsystem generating the command monitors this status event prior to issuing the command on the
remote system. While the monitoring is performed automatically by the command system, Subsystem developers
may need to attach a callback to perform processing on action completion. This callback may be null if no
processing is needed.
<P>
If a command is accepted by the subsystem it causes an independent action to begin. A response to the
command is returned immediately. The action begins matching the current configuration to the new demand
configuration. When the configurations match (i.e., the subsystem has performed the input operations) the action
signals the successful end of the action. If the configurations cannot be matched (whether by hardware failure,
external stop command, timeout, or some other fault) the action signals the unsuccessful end of the action.
<P>
The important features of the command/action/response model are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Commands are never blocked. As soon as one command is started, another one can be issued. The
behavior of the controller when two or more configurations are started can be configured on a
per subsystem basis.
<LI>The actions are performed using one or more separate threads. They can be tuned for priority, number of
simultaneous actions, critical resources, or any other parameters.
<LI>Action completions produce events that tell the state of the current configuration. Actions push the
lifecycle of the configuration through to completion.
<LI>Responses may be monitored by any other subsystems.<P>

<H2>            3.3       Notifications Requirements</H2>
Any application may
post notifications and/or subscribe to notifications posted elsewhere. The notification service is robust and high performance. A notification consists of a topic and a severity. A sequence of notifications with the same topic is referred to as an event.
<P>
The topic is used to identify publishers to subscribers. The severity may be used as a filter
by notification subscribers.
<P>
The notification service has the following general properties:
An notification topic represents a many to many mapping: notifications may be posted to the topic from more
than one source and received by zero or more targets. (Typically, however, most topics will have
a single source.)
<P>
Notifications posted by a single source into an notification topic are received by all targets in the same order as they were posted.
<P>
Delivery of notifications to one subscriber cannot be blocked by the actions of another subscriber.
An notification stream is an abstract concept: a subscriber may subscribe to an notification stream using a wildcarded name in which case the notifications it receives are the merging of all published notifications whose names match that wildcarded name. 
<P>
Notification are not queued by the service. A late subscriber will not see earlier notifications.
<P>
The service does not drop notifications. A published notification will be delivered to all subscribers.
<P>
The notification service supports arbitrary notification topics.
<P>
Notifications are automatically tagged with the source and a timestamp.

<H3>Flow Control : NDDS topics</H3>

Topics provide the basic connection point
between publishers and subscribers. The Topic of
a given publisher on one node must match the
Topic of an associated subscriber on any other
node. If the Topics do not match, communication
will not take place.
<P>
A Topic is comprised of a Topic Name and a
Topic Type. The Topic Name is a string that
uniquely identifies the Topic within a domain.
The Topic Type is the definition of the data
contained within the Topic. Topics must be
uniquely defined within any one particular
domain. Two Topics with different Topic Names
but the same Topic Type definition would be
considered two different Topics within the DDS
infrastructure.

<H2>            3.5       Security Requirements</H3>
<H3>Message timestamps</H3>

Message integrity is enhanced by the inclusion of egree-time and
arrival time (local system clocks) field in every topic
(command , notification, and telemetry). The SAL software
automatically performs validation to ensure early
detection of clock slew or other time related problems.

<H3>Software versioning checksums</H3>

Communications consistency and security is supported by the
inclusion of CRC checksum fields in every topic
definition (command , notification, and telemetry).
The SAL software automatically checks that the publisher and
subscribers are running code generated using identical 
(at the source code level) topic definitions. This prevents
problems associated with maintaining consistent inter-subsystem
interfaces across a widely distributed software development
infrastructure.



<H2>4.0       QUALIFICATION METHODS</H2>

<H3>System dictionary</H3>

A systemwide dictionary of all subsystems, devices, 
actions and states is maintained. All the interactions
between subsystems are automatically checked to verify
that only objects defined in the dictionary can be
used or referenced.

<H3>Command definition database</H3>

A database of permissible commands is maintained
on a per subsystem basis. The database references the
system dictonary and contains 1 record per command.
Each command is constrained in terms of target
subsystems, parameter ranges, maximum frequency, 
timeout, pause/hold potential,and failure severity.
<P>
The database is used to automatically generate 
application level code to perform all command
level interactions. This code is thus guaranteed to be
consistent system wide.


<H3>Telemetry datastream Definition database</H3>

All telemetry datastream definitions are stored in a 
database. Each definition is automatically verified
for compliance with the system dictionary. Telemetry
items are detailed in terms of type, size, frequency, 
units, and value ranges. Any item with a physical 
correlate has an SI unit associated with it. 
<P>
The database is used to automatically generate 
application level code to perform all datastream
topic references. This code is thus guaranteed to be
consistent system wide.


<H3>Code generation</H3>
The primary implementation of the software interace described in this
document will be automatically generated. A software abstraction layer
(SAL) provides a standardized wrapper for the low-level OMG DDS 
functionality which provides the transport later. 
<P>
The permissible commands, datastream contents, and issuable alerts are
all defined by the controls system database and their nomenclature is controlled
by the system dictionary. All intersubsystem messages formats are
autogenerated. Low level data transfers include versioning checksums
based on the source level record definition.
<P>
<H3>Testing</H3>
Test servers and clients are generated which implement the full
set of commands, datastreams, and notifications are defined by
the controls system database. Tests may be configured for a 
variable number of servers/clients and automatically monitored
to ensure compliance with bandwidth and latency requirements.
All test results are archived to the facility database for 
future examination.
