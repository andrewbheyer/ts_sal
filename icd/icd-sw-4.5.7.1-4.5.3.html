<H2>1. SCOPE</H2>
This Interface Control Document (ICD) specifies the interface(s) between mount and other subsystems. Upon formal approval by the line Manager responsible for each participating system, this ICD shall be incorporated into the requirements baseline for each system.
All the interfaces detailed herein are mediated by the OCS Middleware Software-Abstraction-Layer protocols, as detailed in ICD-SW-4.5.7.xx.

<H2>            1.2       Document Overview</H2>
The purpose of the ICD is to specify interface requirements to be met by the participating systems. It describes the concept of operations for the interface, defines the message structure and protocols which govern the interchange of data, and identifies the communication paths along which the data is expected to flow.

<H2>2.       CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS</H2>
<H2>            2.1       System Overviews</H2>
<BR>
<H3>Subsystem  description : ocs</H3>
 The Observatory Control System (OCS) is the master control system that schedules, coordinates, commands and monitors the observatory. 
Through the OCS the system can be started, adjusted during operations, monitored and stopped, both locally and remotely. 
The OCS provides the means to support safe observatory operations day and night.

<P>
<H3>Subsystem  description : mount</H3>
Telescope mount and axes<BR>
Optically the LSST telescope has a unique 3 mirror system. The primary mirror circumscribes
the tertiary mirror such that both surfaces can be made into a single monolithic substrate 
The camera assembly is also circumscribed within the secondary mirror
assembly, forming a convenient package at the telescope top end.
Although the LSST optical design is unique, it can be supported by a conventional telescope
structural arrangement. A stiff mirror cell is used to support the primary and tertiary mirrors, and the top end assembly supports both the secondary mirror assembly and the camera assembly. Both the elevation axis and the azimuth axis are expected to utilize hydrostatic bearings, which are common on large telescopes.
<P>The LSSTs structural arrangement facilitates maintainability. The primary/tertiary mirror cell is connected to the rest of the elevation assembly at four flange locations. This facilitates convenient removal and reinstallation of the mirror cell for recoating and any significant maintenance needs. The top end assembly is also only attached at four flange locations to facilitate removal. The hydrostatic bearing surfaces are enclosed to reduce contamination and susceptibility to damage.
<P>The mount design also incorporates many essential auxiliary components.
Among these are the baffle system, balancing system, damping system, mirror cover, cable wraps and motor drives. The mirror cell is a 2 m deep sandwich with access to the complex systems required for mounting and thermal control of the primary and tertiary mirrors.
<P>Preliminary analysis determined that the lowest natural frequencies of the telescope assembly should be 10 Hz or greater to meet the slew and settling requirements. The telescope mount assembly was designed and analyzed with FEA, with the goal of meeting this 10 Hz requirement. The top end assembly supports the mass of the secondary mirror assembly and camera assembly through the use of 16 hollow rectangular spiders. 
<P>
These hollow spiders are structurally efficient, and the interior provides a convenient location to route the many cables required by the camera and the secondary mirror. These spiders have exterior dimensions of 300 mm x 50 mm and interior dimensions of 210 mm x 36 mm.
<P>The spiders are arranged to minimize the image degradation. All the spiders are arranged in axially aligned pairs. Consequently, the focal plane only sees eight spiders. The eight spider pairs are in a parallel/perpendicular arrangement, which only produces 2 diffraction spikes.
<P>
The instrument assembly includes the camera, rotator, hexapod, cable wrap, integrating
structure and electronics assemblies. The rotator is located between the hexapod and the camera to provide rotation about the optical axis during tracking. The hexapod resides between the rotator and integrating structure, and is used to provide alignment and positioning. 
The electronics assemblies mount to the interior of the integrating structure. The cable wrap resides on the top of the integrating structure.
<P>
The entire instrument assembly can be installed and removed as a single unit. This allows the entire instrument assembly to be put together and tested before integration into the telescope. It also provides for the removal for service and repairs. This installation feature requires that all cabling for the camera be routed from the cameraâ€™s top surface, through the hexapod and the cable wrap and to the integrating structures top surface.
<P>
The secondary mirror assembly is a 100 mm thick glass meniscus supported by 120 axial actuators and 6 tangent actuators and a structural cell for
support. The entire secondary mirror assembly is attached to the top end spider spindle by 6
positioning actuators. The mounting system includes an interface plate to allow removal of the secondary mirror assembly without disconnecting the position actuators. 
The secondary mirror assembly also incorporates a large baffle.
<P>

<H2>3.       DETAILED INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS</H2>
<H2>            3.1       Commanding Requirements</H2>
There are two basic classes of commands used :
Lifecycle commands : commands used by OCS to control the lifecycle
characteristics of applications. Users generally do not need to be concerned with the lifecycle commands
because they are implemented by the underlying infrastructure.
<P>
Functional commands : commands that implement the specific functional characteristics of a
subsystem components.
<P>
Functional operation is based on the Command/Action/Response model that isolates the transmission of the
command from the resulting action that is performed. When an application receives a command, it validates any
Configuration associated with that command and immediately accepts or rejects the command. If the command is
accepted, the application then initiates an independent internal action to meet the conditions imposed by the
command. Once those conditions have been met, an event is posted signifying the successful completion of the
action (or the unsuccessful completion if the conditions can not be met).
<P>
Commands return immediately but the actions that are initiated as a result of a command may take some time to
complete. When the action completes, an action status event is posted that includes the completion status of that
action. The subsystem generating the command monitors this status event prior to issuing the command on the
remote system. While the monitoring is performed automatically by the command system, Subsystem developers
may need to attach a callback to perform processing on action completion. This callback may be null if no
processing is needed.
<P>
If a command is accepted by the subsystem it causes an independent action to begin. A response to the
command is returned immediately. The action begins matching the current configuration to the new demand
configuration. When the configurations match (i.e., the subsystem has performed the input operations) the action
signals the successful end of the action. If the configurations cannot be matched (whether by hardware failure,
external stop command, timeout, or some other fault) the action signals the unsuccessful end of the action.
<P>
The important features of the command/action/response model are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Commands are never blocked. As soon as one command is started, another one can be issued. The
behavior of the controller when two or more configurations are started can be configured on a
per subsystem basis.
<LI>The actions are performed using one or more separate threads. They can be tuned for priority, number of
simultaneous actions, critical resources, or any other parameters.
<LI>Action completions produce events that tell the state of the current configuration. Actions push the
lifecycle of the configuration through to completion.
<LI>Responses may be monitored by any other subsystems.<P>

Command messages issued by ocs must be received by the computer system(s)
of the commanded subsystem within TDB ms. A preliminary response (ACK) must be issued within
TBD ms and received by ocs within TDB ms of the command origination time.
